#phalcon-php

Phalcon-PHP is a free replacement for the [Phalcon Web Framework](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon), delivered as a set of PHP classes based on the [Phalcon Devtools](https://github.com/phalcon/phalcon-devtools). This projects allows the usage of the Phalcon API in runtime enviroments without the ability to set up the phalcon extension (e.g. shared hosting).
This project tries to incease the usage of the Phalcon Web Framework by providing a compatibility layer.

##Development

The current project **is not usable for any purpose** and still requires a lot of implementation. As the base for all developments, this project is using the `phalcon-devtools/ide/{current_version}` tree as a starting point.

##License

To keep the compatibility with the framework, this legacy layer is licensed under the terms of the New BSD license too.
